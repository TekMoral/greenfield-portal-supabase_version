   - Creates class with proper level and category
   - Automatically determines available subjects based on:
     - **Core subjects**: English, Math, Civic Ed (ALL students)
     - **Category subjects**: Physics, Chemistry, Biology (Science students)

### **Step 3: Subject-Teacher Assignment** ‚≠ê **NEW FEATURE**
**Location**: Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Classes ‚Üí [Green Book Icon] "Manage Subjects"

1. **For Each Class**:
   - Click the green book icon next to any class
   - See all available subjects for that class level/category
   - Assign teachers to specific subjects:
     - **English Language** ‚Üí Teacher A (reaches ALL students)
     - **Physics** ‚Üí Teacher B (reaches only Science students)
     - **Mathematics** ‚Üí Teacher C (reaches ALL students)

2. **System Action**:
   - Updates class `subjects` array with teacher assignments
   - Creates proper teacher-subject-class relationships

### **Step 4: Teacher Login & Dashboard**
**Location**: Teacher Portal

   - Redirected to teacher dashboard

2. **Teacher Sees**:
   - **My Classes**: Shows all classes where they teach subjects
   - **Subjects Taught**: Click subject buttons to see students
   - **Assignment Creation**: Can create subject-wide or class-specific assignments

### **Step 5: Assignment Creation**
**Location**: Teacher Dashboard ‚Üí Assignments ‚Üí Create Assignment

1. **Teacher Options**:
   - **Subject**: Select from subjects they teach
   - **Target Type**: 
     - ‚úÖ **All classes taking [Subject]** (e.g., all Physics students)
     - ‚úÖ **Specific classes only** (e.g., only Grade 11A)

2. **System Action**:
   - Assignment reaches correct students based on targeting
   - Students see assignments for subjects they're taking

### **Step 6: Student Assignment Visibility**
**Location**: Student Portal ‚Üí Assignments

1. **Student Sees**:
   - Only assignments for subjects they're taking
   - Based on their class level and category
   - Filtered by teacher-subject assignments

## üéØ Example Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Core Subject Teacher (English)**

1. **Registration**: Teacher registered with subject "English Language"
2. **Assignment**: Assigned to teach English in Grade 10A, 11A, 12A
3. **Login**: Sees all three classes in "My Classes"
4. **Assignment**: Creates "Essay Writing" ‚Üí All English students (90+ students)
5. **Result**: ALL students across all classes see the assignment

### **Scenario 2: Category Subject Teacher (Physics)**

1. **Registration**: Teacher registered with subject "Physics"  
2. **Assignment**: Assigned to teach Physics in Grade 11A Science, 12A Science
3. **Login**: Sees Science classes in "My Classes"
4. **Assignment Options**:
   - **Subject-wide**: "Lab Report" ‚Üí All Physics students (60 students)
   - **Class-specific**: "Makeup Quiz" ‚Üí Only Grade 11A Science (30 students)
5. **Result**: Only Science category students see Physics assignments

### **Scenario 3: Multiple Subject Teacher**

1. **Registration**: Teacher registered with subject "Mathematics"
2. **Assignment**: Assigned to teach Math (core) and Further Math (science)
3. **Login**: Sees all classes for Math, Science classes for Further Math
4. **Assignment Options**:
   - **Mathematics**: Reaches ALL students (core subject)
   - **Further Mathematics**: Reaches only Science students

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Database Structure**:
```javascript
// Class Document
{
  id: "grade11a_science",
  name: "Grade 11A",
  level: "Senior",
  category: "Science",
  subjects: [
    { subjectName: "English Language", teacherId: "teacher1_uid", teacherName: "Mr. Smith" },
    { subjectName: "Mathematics", teacherId: "teacher2_uid", teacherName: "Mrs. Johnson" },
    { subjectName: "Physics", teacherId: "teacher3_uid", teacherName: "Dr. Brown" },
    { subjectName: "Chemistry", teacherId: "teacher4_uid", teacherName: "Ms. Davis" }
  ]
}
```

### **Subject Resolution**:
```javascript
// For Grade 11A Science students:
const studentSubjects = [
  // Core subjects (all students)
  "English Language", "Mathematics", "Civic Education",
  // Science subjects (Science category only)  
  "Physics", "Chemistry", "Biology", "Further Mathematics"
];
```

### **Assignment Targeting**:
```javascript
// Subject-wide assignment
{
  subjectName: "Physics",
  targetType: "subject",
  targetClasses: ["grade10a_science", "grade11a_science", "grade12a_science"]
}

// Class-specific assignment  
{
  subjectName: "Physics",
  targetType: "class", 
  targetClasses: ["grade11a_science"]
}
```
