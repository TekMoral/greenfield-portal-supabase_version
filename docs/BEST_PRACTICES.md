# üìò Project Best Practices

## 1. Project Purpose
Greenfield School Portal is a comprehensive school management system built for private secondary schools. It provides role-based access for admins, teachers, and students to manage academic and administrative operations including student enrollment, class management, exam results, news/events, and reporting. The system uses React with Supabase as the backend for authentication, database, and file storage.

```

**Key Directories:**
- `services/supabase/` - Contains domain-specific service modules (studentService, teacherService, etc.)
- `layouts/` - Role-based layout components that wrap page content
- `components/` - Feature-organized reusable components
- `contexts/` - Global state management using React Context

## 3. Test Strategy
**Framework:** No formal testing framework is currently implemented, but the project structure supports adding Jest/React Testing Library.

**Testing Philosophy:**
- Manual testing through development environment
- Debug components in `components/debug/` for development testing
- Test accounts provided for different roles (admin, teacher, student)
- Database connection testing via `testConnection()` helper in supabaseClient

**Recommended Testing Approach:**
- Unit tests for service functions in `services/supabase/`
- Integration tests for form components
- E2E tests for critical user flows (login, student creation, result entry)

## 4. Code Style

### Language-Specific Rules
- **React Hooks:** Extensive use of `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useState` with proper dependency arrays
- **Async/Await:** Consistent async/await pattern in service functions with try/catch error handling
- **ES6+ Features:** Arrow functions, destructuring, template literals, optional chaining

### Naming Conventions
- **Files:** PascalCase for components (`StudentForm.jsx`), camelCase for utilities (`reportUtils.js`)
- **Components:** PascalCase (`StudentForm`, `DashboardLayout`)
- **Functions:** camelCase (`createStudent`, `getAllStudents`)
- **Variables:** camelCase (`studentData`, `isSubmitting`)
- **Constants:** UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for environment variables (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`)
- **Service Objects:** camelCase with descriptive names (`studentService`, `classService`)

### Error Handling
- **Service Layer:** Consistent return pattern `{ success: boolean, data?: any, error?: string }`
- **Console Logging:** Structured logging with emojis for visual distinction (‚úÖ success, ‚ùå error, üîÑ processing)
- **User Feedback:** Toast notifications for user actions, form validation messages
- **Async Operations:** Always wrapped in try/catch with meaningful error messages

### Form Handling
- **React Hook Form:** Used for all forms with validation rules
- **Auto-generation:** Admission numbers and emails auto-generated based on student data
- **Validation:** Client-side validation with async validation for uniqueness checks
- **State Management:** Form state managed separately from component state

## 5. Common Patterns

### Service Layer Pattern
```javascript
export const serviceObject = {
  async createEntity(data) {
    try {
      // Validation
      // Database operation
      // Return standardized response
      return { success: true, data: result };
    } catch (error) {
      return { success: false, error: error.message };
    }
  }
};
```

### Authentication Context Pattern
- Centralized auth state management via `SupabaseAuthContext`
- Role-based access control with helper functions (`hasRole`, `isAdmin`)
- Automatic profile fetching and session management
- AbortController for canceling async operations

### Component Organization
- Feature-based component organization
- Shared components in `common/` directory
- Role-specific components in dedicated folders
- Layout components for consistent page structure

### Data Fetching Pattern
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const result = await service.getData();
      if (result.success) {
        setData(result.data);
      } else {
        console.error('Error:', result.error);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Exception:', error);
    }
  };
  fetchData();
}, []);
```

## 6. Do's and Don'ts

### ‚úÖ Do's
- Use the standardized service response format `{ success, data, error }`
- Implement proper loading states and error handling in components
- Use React Hook Form for all form implementations
- Follow the established folder structure for new components
- Use the auth context for role-based access control
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks (AbortController, unsubscribe)
- Use descriptive console logging with emoji prefixes for debugging
- Validate user inputs both client-side and server-side
- Use lazy loading for route components to improve performance
- Follow the established naming conventions consistently

### ‚ùå Don'ts
- Don't bypass the service layer for direct Supabase calls in components
- Don't hardcode role checks - use the auth context helper functions
- Don't forget to handle loading and error states in async operations
- Don't create components without proper prop validation
- Don't ignore the established error handling patterns
- Don't mix authentication logic with business logic
- Don't create deeply nested component structures
- Don't forget to implement proper form validation
- Don't use inline styles - prefer Tailwind CSS classes
- Don't create services without proper error handling

## 8. Other Notes

### Database Integration
- Uses Supabase PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS)
- Service functions handle all database operations
- Automatic user profile creation and management
- File upload integration with Supabase Storage

### Role-Based Access Control
- Three main roles: `admin`, `teacher`, `student`
- `super_admin` role for elevated permissions
- Route protection via `RoleBasedRoute` component
- Context-based role checking throughout the application

### Auto-Generation Features
- Admission numbers generated from surname + sequential number + year
- Email addresses systematically generated using format: `firstlettersurnamefirstnamelastThreeNumberOfAdmissionNumber.schoolname@gmail.com`
- Profile images handled via Supabase Storage
- Default passwords set to admission numbers
- Email generation utility in `src/utils/emailGenerator.js` with validation and alternatives

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for all route components
- AbortController for canceling async operations
- Optimized Supabase client configuration
- Custom localStorage wrapper with error handling

### Development Workflow
- Use debug components for testing new features
- Test with provided default accounts for each role
- Follow the established service ‚Üí component ‚Üí page pattern
- Implement proper error boundaries for production stability

### LLM Code Generation Guidelines
When generating new code for this repository:
1. Follow the established service layer pattern for data operations
